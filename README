OmegaGB
Nintendo Game Boy Emulator
By Bit Connor <bit@mutantlemon.com>

=== Requirements:

- ghc 6.6
- gtk2hs (with glade support) 0.9.11
These are the versions I am using. Other versions should probably also work
fine.
If you don't have gtk2hs then you can still run the Ascii tests, which do
ascii art rendering to your terminal.

=== About

This is still in a very rough state. The priority right now is to optimize
the code so that it will run in real time. Right now it runs at about
10% of real time speed on my workstation.

There are still lots of pieces missing for full emulation:

- CPU emulation is almost complete, but it may be buggy
- The memory bus still needs a bit of work. Currently there is no support
  for any of the GB memory banks, so only 32K ROMS have a chance at running.
  Also missing are a bunch of the various GB registers.
- Only a few of the GB interrupts have been implemented.
- The only part of the graphics hardware that is emulated so far is
  rendering of the background map.
- No sound emulation.
- No link cable emulation.

What all this means is that OmegaGB is capable of showing the title screens
of a few games, but not much more.

The goal is to get OmegaGB to a state where it can properly emulate most
games. If you don't have a way to dump your game cartdriges to a rom file
(and don't want to download), then you can get some free (legal) roms at
this website:

I've found that SPACE.GB from the "Diagnostics Rom", by an unknown author
works well. Also, the title screen shows for "Sokoban", by Obsession
Development.
